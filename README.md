This folder contains 4 files:
  \n SEIR_Inputs.xlsm contains the raw input data to forecast COVID spread at municipal and provisional level
  \n SEIR_Model.ipynb is the core location-based hybrid SEIR model which writes the outputs of the model to Excel for ease of consumption into presentations etc.
  \n SEIR_Outputs.xlsx is the file that is generated by SEIR_Model.ipynb, including input assumptions and output matrices and charts
  \n COVID_SA.ipynb is the same hybrid SEIR model with output charts generated in Plotly in the Jupyter notebook.

\nEach of the Jupyter notebooks contains easy-to-follow code with direct references to the input assumptions required.
\nSimply open the files in Jupyter and run them to see the work done to generate output forecasts against actual case and death numbers, for the period 2020 - 2021.
